To do the experiment, we need compile the java files first.

Use terminal and type these commands below:

javac -d . Edges.java Graph.java RunExperiments.java
chmod 777 runTest.sh
./runTest.sh

For first command, you will get a src file and several class files in it.
For second command, we just want to make sure you have the authority to run the shell script.
The last command is to run the shell script and you can get the result in results file.

For this experiment, I ran my code on a Mac OS.
